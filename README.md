## 📖 Project Overview
This project involves:

1. **Data Architecture:** Designing a Modern Data Warehouse Using Medallion Architecture Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers.
2. **ETL Pipelines:** Extracting, transforming, and loading data from source systems into the warehouse.
3. **Data Modeling:** Developing fact and dimension tables optimized for analytical queries.
4. **Analytics & Reporting:** Creating SQL-based reports and dashboards for actionable insights.

## 🏗 Data Architecture
The data architecture for this project follows Medallion Architecture Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers:

1. **Bronze Layer:** Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into SQL Server Database.
2. **Silver Layer:** This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.
3. **Gold Layer:** Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.

## 🚀 Project Requirements

### Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)

#### Objective
Develop a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision-making.

#### Specifications
- **Data Sources**: Import data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files.
- **Data Quality**: Cleanse and resolve data quality issues before analysis.
- **Integration**: Combine both sources into a user-friendly data model for analytical queries.
- **Scope**: Focus on the latest dataset only; historization of data is not required.
- **Documentation**: Provide clear data model documentation to support business stakeholders and analytics teams.
